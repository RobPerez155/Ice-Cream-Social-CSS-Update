Ice Cream Social

# Summary
In this version of Ice Cream Social I have updated all the styling to align more to my vision of what a website like this would look like. My goal in this website was to coordinate the colors and textures to what I imagine an artisinal ice cream shop out of a renovated factory plaza might look like. 

[Ice Cream Social]("Visit the site") is a group project I created with a team of 4 others to bring together a couple of our passions, ice cream and ice cream based excuses to travel. Ice Cream Social allows users to explore, rate, and comment their unique ice cream experiences throughout the world. 

Ice Cream Social utilizes Ruby on Rails on the backend, Javascript React on the frontend, Foundation and Scss for styling.

## To-Do list - Software is never finished.
- The next item that needs to be addressed is a bug with the React Leaflet. Currently, the map is cut up into boxes and is jumbled across the webpage. 

## Future features to be implemented
- Testing
- I would like to get access to an API with data on American vineyards and their wine selections. 
- Expand this program to French, Spanish, Italian, NZ wine regions.
- Chat feature where questions can be left for vintners.
- Turn this into a mobile ready app.
- An internal navigation system that can be used offline.
